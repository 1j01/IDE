# An experimental IDE.
So like I'm using HTML, CSS, JS, node-webkit, Ace Editor, CodeMirror, FireBase, FirePad, and stuff to make this IDE thing. It's gonna be cool.

This repository is mostly just a backup for now.

## Run!
It can be run in different ways:
 * As a node-webkit app
    on Windows, Linux, or OSX (probably)
 * As a web app hosted from the nw app
	You don't need to install the IDE, just click a link generated by the app (eg. 192.67.74.34:1337) and start collaborating!
 * From `index.html`
	It can't save, although once I add the option to connect to a server from the standalone app, you should be able to do so even from `index.html`. (and you might not need `--allow-file-access-from-files`?)

## Todo, and Stuff
	Firepad support!
	State/Options
		State
			(Hot exit / quick IDE reload)
			Workspaces/sessions/tabs? ...
				tabs: [{
					name, ttip,
					file: [rFile], //seriallized as {path,content?}
					appname,
					state: {custom app state}
				}]
		Options
			Accessable to apps
	Arch.
		Apps
			.load();
			.open($ws,file);
			file.read();//
			file.change();//save statesessiondata
			file.live();//execute changes without saving to disk
			file.write();//save to disk (and live())
	Apps
		YWoT
			Ace Editor w/ locked insert mode and selections disabled mimicking Your World of Text
			Actually, YWoT could be like ~1000x+* more effecient/faster with webgl.
		Ace Editor
			quick theme switcher
		CodeMirror
			work
		FirePad
			Rich text mode
			*.fpad.html / *.fpad
		Image Editor
		Audio Editor
	
	Interface for apps to save new files etc.

Built-in way for apps to load and handle not-loaded state
(with loading indicators)

##bug
When you drag a tab, of which there are elevent or more, the first, second, middle and second-last tabs _spaz out_ and converge near the left.

The tabs are sorted based on... a property calculated by sorting them!? Well there's your problem! ... uh so

This is still pretty-weird. 


## maybe
Realtime integration with a multiplayer game engine?
