# An experimental IDE.
So like I'm using HTML, CSS, JS, coffee-script, node-webkit, Ace Editor, CodeMirror, FirePad + FireBase, and stuff to make this IDE thing. It's gonna be cool.

This repository is essentially just a backup for now.

## Run!
It can be run in different ways:
 * As a node-webkit app
    on Windows, Linux, or OSX (probably)
 * As a web app hosted from the nw app
	You don't need to install the IDE, just click a link generated by the app (eg. 192.67.74.34:1337) and start collaborating!
 * From `chrome --allow-file-access-from-files`
	It can't save, although once I add the option to connect to a server from the standalone app, it should have the same abilities as the webserved (appserved?) app.
	(Also might not need `--allow-file-access-from-files`?)

Loading indicators

When you open the sidebar via click the tabs should resize animatedly

##Bug
Anyway they flip out when you drag them there are more than... just about exactly eleven tabs?

The tabs are sorted based on... a property calculated by sorting them!? Well there's your problem! ... uh so

This is still pretty-weird. When there's 11 or more tabs, the first 2 the middle and second-last tabs spaz out and converge near the left.
