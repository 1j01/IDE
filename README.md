# An experimental IDE.
So like I'm using HTML, CSS, JS, coffee-script, node-webkit, Ace Editor, CodeMirror, FirePad + FireBase, and stuff to make this IDE thing. It's gonna be cool.

This repository is essentially just a backup for now.

## Run!
It can be run in different ways:
 * As a node-webkit app (also three different ways)
 * As a web app hosted from the nw app
	You don't need to install the IDE, just click a link generated by the app (eg. 127.0.0.1:1337) and start collaborating!
 * From `chrome --allow-file-access-from-files file://`...`/IDE/index.html`
	It can't save, although once I add the option to connect to a server from the standalone app, it should have the same abilities as the webserved (appserved?) app.
	(Also might not need `--allow-file-access-from-files`?)

Interface for apps to save new files etc.
Built-in way for apps to load and handle not-loaded state

Way for apps to access their folder path (instead of hard-coding it to `apps/time-to-rename-this-or-whatever/`)
And their state. âœ“

###__low priority__
Loading indicators

When you open the sidebar via click the tabs should resize animatedly

##Bug
Anyway they flip out when you drag them there are more than... just about exactly eleven tabs?

The tabs are sorted based on... a property calculated by sorting them!? Well there's your problem! ... uh so
